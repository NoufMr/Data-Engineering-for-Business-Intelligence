# Data-Engineering-for-Business-Intelligence
### Capstone Project from Data Engineering Bootcamp
This project entails typical Analytical Data Engineering, involving the ingestion of data from various sources and its loading into the Snowflake data warehouse. Within the warehouse, after undergoing a series of data transformation processes, we prepare the data for Business Intelligence (BI) usage. The BI tool Metabase connects to the data warehouse to generate diverse dashboards and reports.
